<h2>Lab â„–1. Write a program that takes a random right-linear grammar as input and performs the following transformations::</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1. Given a right-linear grammar, constructs a standard system of equations with regular coefficients, the unknowns of which are the nonterminals of the original grammar.</li>
  <li>2. Solves a standard system of equations with regular coefficients.</li>
  <li>3. Given a regular expression that is a solution to a standard system of equations with regular coefficients, constructs an NFA.</li>
  <li>4. Deterministically models an NFA.</li>
</ul>
